    <h1>﴾BACKSTORIES OF ASSIGNMENTS FROM CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF ARTS﴿</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <img src="Foodameter.jpg" width="350px"height="350px"><h1>Foodameter</h1> Made this through imagination. It was an assignment for making imaginary things that you
            would like to have made some time in future. I made this cooonotative image based on that. This foodameter will help to measure how much food
            has been consumed by a person. We have apps for that but those are quite vague. Thismachine will give a true answer.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img src="business cards project.png" width="350px"height="500px"><h1>Business Cards Project</h1> We were
            to first make monograms using our initials and then make proper business cards arranging all the elements together including a monogram, some card information and lastly some design. I made this on Inkscape.
        </li>

        <li>
            <iframe src="pattern design for coursera project.pdf"width="350px" height="250px" style="float: left;"></iframe> <h1>Pattern Design</h1> This project was to make a pattern design using repetitions. I made this on Inkscape.
        </li>

        <li>
            <iframe src="Georgia.pdf" width="350px" height="250px"style="float: left;"> </iframe> <h1>A Summary on Georgia</h1>This assignment was to research on any one typeface from a given list of typefaces and write two to three paragraphs about it, while
            using typography priniciples to write the assignments.
        </li>

        <li>
            <img src="scale+weight.png"width="250px" height="250px"><img src="scale+weight.png"width="250px" height="250px"><img src="scale+direction+form.png"width="250px" height="250px"><img src="weight+space+texture.png"width="250px" height="250px"><h1>Elements</h1>This was to make some arrangements using six main elements of graphic design.
        </li>
         
        <li>
            <img src="Better safe than sorry.jpg" width="500px"height="350px"><h1>Better Safe Than Sorry image</h1> This assignment also wanted us to make a connotative image using a scene. So I made this. It was made directly using a mouse so the image isn't very good and it was when I first started with graphic designing.
